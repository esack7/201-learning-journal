I was kind of worried about this week in class.  I heard it was the straw that usually breaks the camels back.  Yesterday, Monday, was pretty intense, but I felt I had a rather decent grasp of literal objects and rendering content to the DOM.  Today was definitely tough.  I feel that I am able to follow along in class during the examples and everything makes sense, but once lab came, I just couldn't connect the dots anywhere. I think it's a combination of lack of sleep and and overload on my brain. I think overall I am grasping all the concepts, I am just having a hard time when I have to put it in functional code.
Lab time has been great.  I really appreciate the environment and the willingness of all the student and TA's to help out when someone is lost. Most of the time you just grasp something and then you have a chance to help on of your partners out with what you've just learned.  Here's to learning to code!
