# Learning Journal: Day 17
## Project week

Our team has nearly approached the MVP of our project by the end of yesterday.  I have really enjoyed the team environment and I feel it caused great productivity and will produce great quality.  I think one of the biggest challenges in using someone else code for the game is that we needed be able to decifer the code to be able to make it interact with our app.  At least, for me this was challenging.

I feel like our team dynamic is great.  I started coming down with a cough and runny nose yesterday, so physically I am feeling a bit run down, but I got a full night sleep last night and hopefully that helps.
