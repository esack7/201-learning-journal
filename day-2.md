# Learning Journal: Day 2

I am rather excited for this class with Code Fellows.  I have tried over the last two months to learn coding on my own, but I have come to realized that a classroom/lab setting is probably where I am going to learn the best.

Over the last two days of 201 I have learned the following things:

 - A basic understanding of HTML and how it should be structured using decendants.
 - That CSS styles and creates layout for your website or HTML content.
 - Javascript creates the action in website and manages user interaction.
 - Objects are the data or that Javascript utilizes
 - Events are the actions that that Javascript takes via flow and functions.
 How to utilize the terminal to command my laptop in a more effective manner
 - How git works on and how to utilize GitHub
 - A basic understanding of MVC architecture.
 - Different types of Javascript data types: strings, numbers (integer and floating points), and booleans.
