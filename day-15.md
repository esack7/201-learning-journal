Well, instruction for this course has come to an end and now it's time to put what I have learned to practice this coming week. I am excited about my project team and about our decision on the project we are going to do.  I think my weakest points right now are CSS and JS.  Although I feel like I have gained a lot of ground in JS and I am excited to start to get more solid. Now that I have realized the scope of the things I can accomplish with what we've already learned, I have been thinking of different ideas and how I can do those.  I know I will need to wait on any of those until project week has finished, but it is exciting to see a future of actually developing software and apps that people can use.
