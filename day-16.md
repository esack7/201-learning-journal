# Learning Journal: Day 16
## Project week

So for our final project, we are going to create a web app that simulates an arcade game in which the user/s play the classic PONG game.  We call our project RePONG.  The team is made up of myself, Austin, Chris, and Kimmer. The code for the actual pong game it's self is from a tuturial online that we are essentially utilizing as a library for the project. The bulk of what our project consists of is the UX/UI of the app itself, the user input, tying the user interaction with the game, such as points and wins, to localStorage and then displaying the results on the leaderboard.

I am excited about the group of people I am working with and about the project itself. Most of all is that in building this app, it's giving me ideas and confidence to step out and build more myself.
