# Learning Journal: Day 4

The last two days things have really accelerated in the class.  Delving into Javascript has made things quiet a bit more complicated, but has also made things a lot more interesting. Understanding flow and structuring the code is probably my biggest challenge when it comes to Javascript. When it comes to HTML/CSS, I feel like CSS is going to be the beast I am going to struggle to overcome.  I am glad that we have the tutorial in todays lesson to help with that.

- Pair Programming went pretty well and I think it is going to be productive to do in the future!
