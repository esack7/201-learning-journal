# Learning Journal: Day 19
## Project week

Thursday was our wrap up day. We worked pretty hard Thursday morning and most the early afternnon to tweek our site and get things as close to what we wanted as we could.  Then we did a mock presentation, rather unprepared, and got a good amount of feedback from Sam and the TA's on what we needed in our presentation.  The last part of the day was spent planning our presentation.  Great team work!
