# Learning Journal: Day 20
## Project week

Today was project presentation day. The teams prep the day before helped in having a good game plan for our final mock presentation and finally our official presentation.  Our group went first, which I liked.  I think the presentation went great also.

This 201 class has been very intense, but I feel like I have learned so much.  I am very much looking forward to strarting 301 in a week.
