I feel like I have gotten a rather good handle on the things we've learned until this point.  That being said it's all so new that I worry that what we've learned won't stick long term.  I have found that I enjoy figuring out how to connect the dots and not so much making things look great.  That being said, I hope that we soon get some very practical usage info on how to use CSS to accomplish the tasks.
