I don't know if it's a cyclic thing or just my method of learning, but I have hit a wall. All the things we have learned, I feel I have grasped, but when it comes to the application, putting it all down in code, I feel that I just can't move forward.  Well maybe a little forward, but really, really, really slow.  I guess slow is okay, but the pace of this class doesn't lend well to slow. I am hoping that things start to "click" soon.
