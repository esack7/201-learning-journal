The last few days have been pretty difficult.  At times, I have had the temptation to throw in the towel. However, finally having break throughs and completing the assignments (slowly) have helped.  I was encouraged by the one on one meeting with Sam.  It was good to hear his perspective.  ChartJS and adding localStorage to the app seemed to come rather easily.  Peer programming...it works!
