# Learning Journal: Day 18
## Project week

We are almost there with finishing our project.  We really only have a few fine tuning things to do and and possibly one more functionality thing, but that would be a stretch goal.  This project week has been a great learning experience to stretch me as a developer and help me think bigger than just myself and my own coding. The team dynamic can really cause great productivity, which it has for us this week.
